####About

HexChat is an IRC chat program. It allows you to join multiple IRC channels (chat rooms) at the same time, talk publicly, private one-on-one conversations etc.

HexChat is based on XChat, but unlike XChat it's completely free for both Windows and Unix-like systems. Since XChat is open source, it's perfectly legal. For more info, please read the [Shareware Background](shareware.html).

HexChat was originally called XChat-WDK which in turn was a successor of freakschat. For more info, please read the [announcement](2012/07/06/announcement.html).

Besides HexChat, you can find builds of various open source libraries as well. Most of them are used by HexChat itself. Feel free to browse our site for more info.
