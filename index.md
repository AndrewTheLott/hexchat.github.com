####About

HexChat is an IRC client based on XChat, but unlike XChat it's completely free for both Windows and Unix-like systems. Since XChat is open source, it's perfectly legal. For more info, please read the [Shareware Background](shareware.html).

HexChat was originally called XChat-WDK which in turn was a successor of freakschat. For more info, please read the [announcement](news/announcement.html).
